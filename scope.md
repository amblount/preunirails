### Business model
We are building a form submission application that enables parents to create a single profile for themselves and child node profiles for their children to create a whole application for preschool. We collect all of the pertinent information about the child and we electronically submit the application to any one of the 27 preschools in the database. This eliminates the need for a paper trail on behalf of the preschool owner and the parent. We plan to scale the business by personalizing the profile of the student and enabling the personalization to contribute to the election of preschools and eventually after school program. The long term goal is to create a system which tracks a student from pre-school to high school and can even turn into a form of the common application so that. student can build off of one application and not have to continue to write the same experiences over and over again. We plan on building out integrations with health care providers to share health care records and other types of providers so that there is seamless record transfer between child care providers.
