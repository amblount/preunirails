<p>AMA offers full day child care (part day child care by request) and P-T/F-T, M-F 8:00am-5:00pm. Extended child care may be requested for an additional monthly tuition fee, M-F 7:00am-6:00pm. Your monthly tuition fee will be calculated by adding all fees for a week together and multiplying the weekly total by four. In short, the monthly tuition fee will remain the same quantity throughout the all year round school year, which is the sum of <strong> <em> <u> four weeks (20 days) of child care services per month </u> </em> </strong> , and regardless of total weeks in the month. P-T student&rsquo;s days of care will vary according to schedule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong> <em> <u> Tuition rates are due on the 25 <sup> th </sup> of each month. </u> </em> </strong> <em> Drop-in </em> child care fees will be paid for by no later than the day of rendered child care services, if not enrolled permanently with A.M.A. Otherwise, the client may add both <em> drop-in or late pick up fees </em> to the permanent monthly tuition payment (see tuition fees schedule for details). <u> If a tuition payment is late, there will be a penalty fee charge of <strong> $50.00 </strong> and <strong> $25.00 </strong> for every tardy day to follow </u> . <strong> <u> Penalty fees are due at the time of your permanent and monthly child care tuition payment, by the 25th of the month. </u> </strong></p>

<p><strong> <u> Financial Aid Assistance and Subsidized Families: </u> </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong> Subsidized tuition payment applies to P-T and F-T permanent child care schedules for a 1 yr. commitment. In order to preserve the student&rsquo;s childcare slot parents will submit the &ldquo;re-enrollment&rdquo; form each school year by March 1st. </strong> Parents are responsible for all child care associated fees (i.e. enrollment fees and late pick-up fees @ $2.00/minute, drop-in fees, early termination/missing 30-day notice of termination fees, AMA property damage fees, personal leave and AMA holiday/vacation schedule, etc.) AND for the monthly submission of government agency time sheets, and ALL enrollment paper work with the agency. Time sheets must be filled out and signed by both parties and hand delivered on the last day of care monthly, and by the parent. If subsidized payment is not received by mid-month (one month behind), parents are responsible for the full tuition payment, and must pay the difference in monthly rate, if the subsidized agency does NOT pay for the entire monthly tuition fee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><em> Your low income scholarship, subsidized tuition rate and sibling discount may not be substituted, combined or barter traded in any way. </em></li>
<li><strong> <em> <u> Financial Aid assistance may be available for low-income families on a first come and first serve basis and depending on the urgency of need for the family. </u> </em> </strong></li>
<li><strong> <em> <u> You must submit 3 current work paystubs to determine the rate of scholarship. </u> </em> </strong></li>

<p><strong> <u> Student Enrollment Fees: </u> </strong></p>
<p><strong> <em> <u> &nbsp; </u> </em> </strong></p>
<p>There is a one time and non-refundable infrastructure fee of $325.00 is due by the final enrollment parent meeting (3 <sup> rd </sup> and final meeting). This fee will be paid for in full with that of the application fee of $25.00 and the first month of tuition payment in order to reserve child care with AMA. Each family will cover the cost of the <strong> <u> one time and non-refundable enrollment fees of $350.00 </u> </strong> for each child enrolled in the program. No sibling discounts apply to this fee.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong> <u> Late Student Pick-Up &amp; Early Drop-Off Policy (See Updated Parent Handbook): </u> </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Late pick-up affects the children in negative ways, making them feel abandoned, lonely, and confused about the situation. A calm transition between AMA and home maintains the child&rsquo;s sense of well-being. A rushed or late pick-up does not allow these young children to adjust easily to changes in their environment. In addition, teachers have families of their own to attend to, have other commitments, or simply want to go home on time. Parents who pick up their children later than scheduled create difficulties for others in the program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have suggestions for avoiding this problem all together. Parents can communicate with other parents who pick up their children at the same time at the academy, and set an arrangement to cover for one another in cases of unexpected delay. If you feel that you might create chronic lateness, you should talk with the Program Director, who may offer other suggestions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We ask that you arrive to pick up your child fifteen minutes before AMA&rsquo;s closing time. This allows you time to greet your child, perhaps chat with teachers, gather your child&rsquo;s belongings and leave the Academy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you will be tardy for pick-up, please call A.M.A administration/teachers at <strong> <u> 510-336-7082 </u> . </strong> You may want to arrange for someone on your emergency card to pick up your child, including other parents. Children will not be released to anyone under the age of 18 yrs. old.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong> <em> &nbsp; </em> </strong></p>
<p><strong> <em> ***Please remember to keep your student emergency form, potty, and feeding plan (if applicable &amp; for Infants &amp; Toddlers only) up to date, including the child 911 summary form (new 2013-2014 enrollment form). *** </em> </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parents will give A.M.A at least 24-hour written notice (via email) if someone besides parent(s)/guardian will be picking up his/her child (s). If your child is not picked up by the end of the day, a person from the emergency contact form will be contacted and asked to pick up your student.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Children will arrive to school by no later than 9:00am for a smooth morning transition, M-F.</p>

<p>The parent handbook contains important information regarding school policy and procedure as it pertains to specific classrooms and their students.

<p><strong> <u> Transitional Child Care Schedule: </u> </strong></p>
<p><strong> <u> &nbsp; </u> </strong></p>
<p>Depending on the previous child care experience of your child and days of care with AMA, we recommend that parents participate in a <u> 1-2 weeks&rsquo; transitional child care plan. </u> Transitional time equates to additional bonding time for parents and their child, during in which the parents may explain AMA norms and daily schedule. Transitional time is essential for incoming children, in that they gain a sense of security and comfort before the parent leaves for the day. The following is a sample transitional child care schedule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong> <u> *Sample Plan: </u> </strong> Parents are highly recommended to participate in transitional playdates for up to two weeks prior to starting the permanent child care schedule. The playdates may run up to two hours, from 8:30am-10:30am, M-F. We recommend that parents spend about 10-15 minutes with their child during drop-off and within the first week of permanent care only. Parents may read a book or participate in another play activity before leaving for the day. Do provide your child with up to 3 exit-transition warnings before kissing your child goodbye for the day. You may ask teachers for drop-off help. The drop-in child care fee is that of <strong> <u> $15.00/hour and payment </u> </strong> is due (in full) on the day of enrollment.</p>

<p><strong> <u> Termination Policies and Procedures: </u> </strong></p>
<p><strong> &nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>This contract may be terminated by either parent/guardian or provider by giving a <em> 30 days&rsquo; written notice </em> in advance of ending date. If a 30 days&rsquo; notice is not given in writing, a <strong> <u> $25.00 penalty fee </u> </strong> will be applied towards your final tuition payment. Payment by parent(s)/guardian is due on the first day of the month, whether or not the child is absent from AMA. The provider may terminate the contract without notice for frequent late tuition payments or other defiant behavior by the child and/or parent (s). AMA may refuse childcare if tuition fees are not paid, frequent tardy tuition payments, and/or flatulent form of payment/payment plan. The provider may make changes to the contract and will review such changes with the parent(s)/guardian before signing a revised contract. An <strong> <u> early termination fee of $50.00 </u> </strong> will be applied, if you choose to terminate the contract before your one-year commitment to the program.</p>

<p>In an effort to unify families and create strong communal bonds within our school, we encourage parents to join the parent committee (i.e. fundraising, maintenance, classroom assistance, communal bonding and school marketing, among others) by volunteering whenever possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*We ask that parents clean out their child&rsquo;s cubby and art box/binder each day and to take linens/nap mattress home each week for proper washing. Please help our staff maintain a clean and organized classroom. You are welcome to search for child&rsquo;s missing clothing, linens, etc. by looking through the &ldquo;communal lost &amp;b found box.&rdquo; Each classroom contains this box for your help in tracking down lost child belongings. AMA is not responsible for lost or damaged child belongings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Please sign-in and out each day by reading the &ldquo;Student Observation Log&rdquo; (binder containing child report for the day) and by reading the latest school news, posted in the &ldquo;Parent&rsquo;s Corner,&rdquo; which is located in the school lobby.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Tuition payment and formal paper work will be placed inside the school mail box, located in the school lobby (underneath the mural painting). An exterior mailbox is located upstairs (above the school and next to the school banner), next door to the BACT entrance, during before and after business hours for tuition payment submission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We ask that parents continue the Spanish Immersion, cultural and family values-leaning experience while students are away from school. Read to our child each night for about 15-20 minutes in Spanish, listen to musical tunes in Spanish and eat out at your local Latin-American restaurant to reinforce learning while away from home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, we welcome parents to participate in all school field trips, school events, and summer program. We have an open door policy. If you can play an instrument, make jewelry, garden and cook; please let us know, as we would greatly appreciate your participation in our circle/art time. We are always in need of a handy person to provide maintenance to our facility. We offer an open-door policy to our AMA families. Follow us on Face Book, and read your monthly Parent&rsquo;s Connections and student observational log daily for important school, and child information. PLEASE WEAR YOUR SCHOOL TOP DURING ALL FIELD TRIPS PARENTS. THANK YOU!</p>
